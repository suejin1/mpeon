DESCRIPTION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To compute the average time to perform calculator operations, I used the gettimeofday method.
I declared variables to hold the values for the time it took to perform each individual operation.
I calculated these values by running gettimeofday at the start and end of each operation. I then 
calculate the operation time by getting the difference of the time at the end of operation by 
the time at the start of the operation. When the user ends the program, the average is calculated
by adding the values up and divide by 6 as there are 6 commands.
